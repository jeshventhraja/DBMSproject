## What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?
A database management system is a software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.
## What does the project show?
In this project we have implemented a simulation of a DBMS in C++ by defining our own commands with a command-line type interface.
We have defined the following commands:
* help<br/>
   -Gives details on the other commands
* create<br/>
   -Used to create databases/tables
* insert<br/>
   -Used to add columns to the table
* delete<br/>
   -Used to delete tables, records and columns
* show<br/>
   -Used to show details of databases, tables
* use<br/>
   -Used to switch to a different database
